# custom-autoscaler-operator

The CustomScaler controller provides custom scaling for Kubernetes Deployments based on metric thresholds. e.g Number of queued jobs, number of messages in a queue, etc.

## Description

The custom-autoscaler-operator is a specialized Kubernetes operator designed to offer flexible and user-defined autoscaling capabilities. Unlike traditional Kubernetes autoscalers that rely mainly on CPU and memory metrics, the CustomScaler controller within this operator allows for scaling decisions based on a wider variety of metrics. This could include application-specific indicators such as the number of queued jobs in a processing queue, the volume of messages in a message broker, or any other custom metric that can provide insights into the load or demand on your applications.



## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

```sh
make deploy IMG=rscheele3214/custom-autoscaler-operator:latest
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

// TODO

### How it works

Upon detecting that a custom metric has crossed a threshold, the CustomScaler controller will adjust the replica count of the target deployment either up or down, depending on the metric value. Once a scaling action is taken, the controller enters a cooldown period during which no further scaling actions will be performed.


### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## TODO

### fetchMetricValue Function:

- This function is meant to fetch the metric value from a given metric source, potentially from monitoring systems like Prometheus.
- The actual logic to fetch this metric is still pending.

### isMetricSourceValid Function:

- This function serves to validate the given metric source, perhaps by making a test connection or through other validation mechanisms.
- The actual validation logic is still pending.
